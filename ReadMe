Previously, my team and I had utilized the MX2 two channel MOCO solution invented by Jay Burlage from Dynamic Perception 
for our DIY motion timelapse dolly system project.

After finding out that the original version had numerous update releases, we first came to the conclusion that 
modifications were not necessary; however, later on, re-artwork was done on the hardware shield.

The purpose of this alteration was to switch out from the more expensive and hard-to-find optocoupler 
to the more affordable PC817 x 2 from the design. In addition, several other components were exchanged 
with parts that were more widely available within Asia.

Following the GPL v3.0 policy for the MX2 controller made by Dynamic Perception, we are making the modified source public.

We believe that this will be useful to those who seek to design and use 
simple DC motor-based timelapse motion control system especially within Asia.

The re-artwork was done on PADS and Gerber files are also attached here.
